## Project Quirks/ Things that don't work
# My github had a stroke when I accidentally pushed some stuff from the wrong account causing a slight headache, but pulling the incorrect fork and reverting the changes fixed the problems. 

# This is just to test if I can clone with the proper credentials... 
# They were not the right credentials :/
